# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI
If you don't want to read this, just run main.py to play

Hello, this is my Tic-Tac-Toe AI
The code itself is split across three files

main.py
THIS IS THE FILE YOU RUN
I don't know what happens if you run the other files so please don't
This file contains the inital menu and controls everything
The score at the bottom is in the forms
wins-draws-losses

game.py
This file contains the actual game, don't run this code, 
if you want to interact with the board all you have to do is click the square that you want to place your cross or nough

ai.py
This file contains your enemy (don't open it, hes very shy)
The AI utilizes the minimax algorithm (hence why it takes a while for him to play the first move)
I have decided to name the AI ChipperBot (and by that I asked ChatGPT)

Have fun and good luck !!!
